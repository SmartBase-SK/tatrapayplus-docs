# Create Payment

To create a payment using the Python SDK, call the `TatrapayPlusClient.create_payment()` method.

  <CodeBlock language="python">{createPayment}</CodeBlock>
</details>

## Common Data

Tatrapay Plus supports multiple payment methods. Depending on the selected method, you can include additional optional fields. However, some data is **mandatory** for all payment types:

```python
base_payment=BasePayment(
    end_to_end="VS0123456789/SS0123456789/KS123456",
    instructed_amount=Amount(
        amount_value=99.99,
        currency="EUR"
    )
)
```
:::warning

Most common issue is that value in `instructed_amount.amount_value` field is not rounded properly and API will reject such a data.
Please round your data to **2 decimals places**.

:::

### Modify language and preferred method

By default, tatrapay+ gateway will show all available payment methods and payment gateway is shown in default **Slovak** language.
If you want to change this behaviour you can pass `language` and `preferred_method` param to `create_payment`.

If `preferred_method` is available user will be directly navigated to this method.

<details>
    <summary>Show gateway in English with bank transfer method</summary>

```python
client.create_payment(
    payment_data,
    'en',
    'BANK_TRANSFER'
)
```
</details>

### Redirect URI

Redirect URI is used as return address after customer finish payment. This URI is necessary and is used to [process result of the payment](/docs/libraries/python/v1.0.0/process_payment).

If your application serves multiple locales with distinct URIs for example:
- https://example.com for one locale
- https://example.com/de/ for German users

you must register both URIs in the developer portal.
Then, when making a `create_payment` request, be sure to include the redirect URI that matches the user's locale.
:::warning

This URI must exactly match the URI defined in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.tatrabanka.sk/pages/devportal/sk/#/)

## Specific payment method data

### Bank transfer and QR pay

For this payment method you need to define attribute `bank_transfer`. **It can be empty** or contains additional information.
If you omit this attribute, bank transfer wouldn't be shown.

```python
bank_transfer \=BankTransfer(remittance_information_unstructured: "Additional informations")
```
### Card pay

This payment methods requires `card_detail.card_holder`, `user_data.first_name` and `user_data.last_name`.
One of `user_data.email` or `user_data.phone` is required, based on these data are send notifications to customers.

:::tip

The SDK automatically strips diacritical marks from characters in the `card_detail.card_holder` field, so **you don't need** to handle this conversion yourself.

:::

```python
user_data=UserData(
        first_name="Janko",
        last_name="Hruska",
        email="janko.hruska@example.com",
        phone="+421911123456",
    ),

card_detail=CardDetail( card_holder="Janko Hruška")
```
### PayLater (Na splátky<sup>TB</sup>)

This payment method requires information about items that were bought by customer.
This structure is more complex and description of all fields can be found in [API reference](/docs/api/initiate-payment).

:::warning

The API will reject requests where `instructed_amount.amount_value` doesn't match the **sum of all total_item_price** values.

:::

```python
pay_later = PayLater(
    order=Order(
        order_no="ORDER123456",
        order_items=[
            OrderItem(
                quantity=1,
                total_item_price=10.0,
                item_detail=ItemDetail(
                    item_detail_sk=ItemDetailLangUnit(
                        item_name="Testovací produkt",
                        item_description="Popis produktu",
                    ),
                    item_detail_en=ItemDetailLangUnit(
                        item_name="Test Product",
                        item_description="Product description",
                    ),
                ),
                item_info_url="https://tatrabanka.sk",
            )
        ],
        preferred_loan_duration=12,
        down_payment=1.0,
    ),
    capacity_info=CapacityInfo(
        monthly_income=2000.0,
        monthly_expenses=800.0,
        number_of_children=1,
    ),
)
```

## Response

After you create reqeust to initiate payment you receive InitiatePaymentResponse with following data:
```python
InitiatePaymentResponse(
    payment_id='d7ec77c6-39d8-4011-a462-1a0f1b23f65f',
    tatra_pay_plus_url='https://api.tatrabanka.sk/tatrapayplus/sandbox/v1/auth?paymentId=d7ec77c6-39d8-4011-a462-1a0f1b23f65f&client_id=l7ba7ffa0bf66b49b88d17dfe144955f54&hmac=7043761cb4cff51d1d084f90cd25d370b89515a1c43c39e6ea459dd504059834',
    available_payment_methods=[
        AvailablePaymentMethod(
            payment_method=PaymentMethod.BANK_TRANSFER,
            is_available=True,
        ),
        AvailablePaymentMethod(
            payment_method=PaymentMethod.CARD_PAY,
            is_available=True,
        ),
    ]
)
```
You should save `payment_id` to your order associated with this payment. You will later need it to [retrieve status of payment](/docs/libraries/python/v1.0.0/process_payment).
Then you have two options of displaying payment gateway:
1. Simply redirect user to gateway, field `tatra_pay_plus_url`.
2. Show payme
