# Pre authorization

We recommend to use the "pre-authorization" transaction type in case of the assumption of an increased number of cancellation requests or partial cancellation of payments due to unavailability of goods/services, changes in the price of the order, etc.
If you want to use pre-authorization for card payments you can pass `isPreAuthorization: true` while initiating payment.

In case of payment by pre-authorisation, the merchant is obliged to ensure the termination/cancellation of the pre-authorisation by **calling the online interface within 7 days** from the date on which the pre-authorisation was made.
If the merchant performs a pre-authorisation transaction for the purpose of [registering the card for ComfortPay](/docs/libraries/node/v1/save_card), the transaction will not be cleared and will be released to the cardholder by the cardholder's bank within a few days.
We do not recommend making a subsequent reversal of this type of transaction. This is due to the authorization message containing all the information for a future recurring payment.
There is a risk that the customer's bank will not retain this information as part of the cancellation of the transaction.
