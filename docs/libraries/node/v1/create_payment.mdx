# Create payment

To be able to create payment you need to call `sdk.createPayment`.

<details>

    <CodeBlock language="jsx">{createPayment}</CodeBlock>
</details>

## Common data

Payment gateway supports multiple payment methods and based on your need you can send more or less info in your `createPayment` call.
However, some of the data are mandatory for all payment methods.

```javascript
basePayment: {
  endToEnd: "/VS0123456789/SS0123456789/KS123456",
  instructedAmount: {
    amountValue: 99.99,
    currency: "EUR",
  },
},
```

:::warning

Most common issue is that value in `instructedAmount.amountValue` field is not rounded properly and API will reject such a data.
Please round your data to **2 decimals places**.

:::

### Modify language and preferred method

By default, tatrapay+ gateway will show all available payment methods and payment gateway is shown in default **Slovak** language.
If you want to change this behaviour you can pass `language` and `preferredMethod` param to `createPayment`.

If `preferredMethod` is available user will be directly navigated to this method.

<details>
    <summary>Show gateway in English with bank transfer method</summary>

```javascript
const { data, error } = await sdk.createPayment(
  ...,
  REDIRECT_URI,
    // highlight-start
  'en',
  'BANK_TRANSFER',
    // highlight-end
);
```

</details>

### Redirect URI

Redirect URI is used as return address after customer finish payment. This URI is necessary and is used to [process result of the payment](/docs/libraries/node/v1/process_payment).

If your application serves multiple locales with distinct URIs for example:
- https://example.com for one locale
- https://example.com/de/ for German users

you must register both URIs in the developer portal.
Then, when making a `createPayment` request, be sure to include the redirect URI that matches the user's locale.
:::warning

This URI must exactly match the URI defined in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.tatrabanka.sk/pages/devportal/sk/#/)

:::

## Specific payment method data

### Bank transfer and QR pay

For this payment method you need to define attribute `bankTransfer`. **It can be empty** or contains additional information.
If you omit this attribute, bank transfer wouldn't be shown.

```javascript
bankTransfer: {
  remittanceInformationUnstructured: "Additional informations"
}
```

### Card pay

This payment methods requires `cardDetail.cardHolder`, `userData.firstName` and `userData.lastName`.
One of `userData.email` or `userData.phone` is required, based on these data are send notifications to customers.

:::tip

The SDK automatically strips diacritical marks from characters in the `cardDetail.cardHolder` field, so **you don't need** to handle this conversion yourself.

:::

```javascript
userData: {
  firstName: "Jozko",
  lastName: "Hruska",
  email: "test@tatrabanka.ok",
  phone: "+421911123456",
},
cardDetail: {
  cardHolder: "Jozko Hruska",
}
```

### PayLater (Na spl√°tky<sup>TB</sup>)

This payment method requires information about items that were bought by customer.
This structure is more complex and description of all fields can be found in [API reference](/docs/api/initiate-payment).

:::warning

The API will reject requests where `instructedAmount.amountValue` doesn't match the **sum of all totalItemPrice** values.

:::

```javascript
payLater: {
  order: {
    orderNo: "111",
    orderItems: [
      {
        quantity: 1,
        totalItemPrice: 200,
        itemDetail: {
          itemDetailSK: {
            itemName: "Stol",
            itemDescription: "biely stol",
          },
          itemDetailEN: {
            itemName: "Table",
            itemDescription: "White table",
          },
        },
        itemInfoURL: "https://url.sk",
      },
    ],
    preferredLoanDuration: 24,
    downPayment: 10,
  },
  capacityInfo: {
    monthlyIncome: 1000,
    monthlyExpenses: 0,
    numberOfChildren: 0,
  },
}
```

## Response

After you create reqeust to initiate payment you receive following data:
```json
{
  "paymentId": "580ff61e-efdd-40e5-8bc4-c373d59cf0c2",
  "tatraPayPlusUrl": "https://api.tatrabanka.sk/tatrapayplus/production/v1/auth?paymentId=580ff61e-efdd-40e5-8bc4-c373d59cf0c2&client_id=l7ba7ffa0bf66b49b88d17dfe144955f54&hmac=19be0bf2a2e5d5e8626c01203ba747648d8fea0fd0106e51786a13183e9e91c8",
  "availablePaymentMethods": [
    {
        "isAvailable": true,
        "paymentMethod": "CARD_PAY"
    },
    {
        "isAvailable": false,
        "reasonCodeMethodAvailabilityDescription": "Method is not in the partner contract",
        "paymentMethod": "PAY_LATER",
        "reasonCodeMethodAvailability": "NO_CONTRACT"
    },
    {
        "isAvailable": true,
        "paymentMethod": "BANK_TRANSFER"
    },
    {
        "isAvailable": true,
        "paymentMethod": "QR_PAY"
    }
]
}
```
You should save `paymentId` to your order associated with this payment. You will later need it to [retrieve status of payment](/docs/libraries/node/v1/process_payment).
Then you have two options of displaying payment gateway:
1. Simply redirect user to gateway, field `tatraPayPlusUrl`.
2. Show payment gateway in iframe. For detailed description how to use iframe please visit [Developer portal documentation](https://developer.tatrabanka.sk/apihub/#/apis/f438e906-7845-4bc1-a028-73d3f9547d2a/show/doc?mode=view&uri=iFrame-podpora)
