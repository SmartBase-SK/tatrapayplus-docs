## Retrieve payment status

Based on received GET params you should retrieve status of payment as following:

import getPaymentStatus from '!!raw-loader!@site/code_samples/python/v1.0.0/get_payment_status.py';

<CodeBlock language="python">{getPaymentStatus}</CodeBlock>

:::info
- In **sandbox** mode, the payment status changes from `PENDING` to the target status after a short delay (usually 2‚Äì5 minutes).
- In **production** mode, the payment status is usually already updated to the final status by the time the user is redirected. However, in some cases, it may still be `PENDING` for a short time due to processing delays.
:::

The result includes a `simpleStatus` attribute, which simplifies the status of a payment into one of the following four values:
- **AUTHORIZED**
- **CAPTURE**
- **REJECTED**
- **PENDING**

The simpleStatus is determined according to the table below. If none of the conditions match, the status defaults to `PENDING`.

| Payment Method | CAPTURE                      | REJECTED   | AUTHORIZED |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| QR_PAY         | ACCC                              | CANC, RJCT           |                      |
| BANK_TRANSFER  | ACSC, ACCC                              | CANC, RJCT           |                      |
| PAY_LATER      | LOAN_APPLICATION_FINISHED, LOAN_DISBURSED | CANCELED, EXPIRED    |                      |
| CARD_PAY       | OK, CB                                  | FAIL                 | PA                   |
| DIRECT_API     | OK, CB                                  | FAIL                 |                      |

Your implementation should take the appropriate action based on the value of `simple_status`.

`data` attribute contains all the information based on structure described in [API reference](/docs/api/get-payment-intent-status).

The response also includes saved card information (if the customer chooses to save their card details).
More details on this feature can be found [üí≥ here üí≥](/docs/libraries/python/v1.0.0/save_card).

## Periodical task

Some payments may be processed later.
Therefore, you should periodically check the status of **"pending" payments**.
We recommend setting up a scheduled task that retrieves all pending payments from your system.
Using the saved `payment_id` with the `get_payment_status` method, you can obtain the current status and take the appropriate action in your system.

Recommended pooling rates based on **age of orders**:

| Time Range            | Polling Frequency   |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| First hour            | Every 5 minutes     |
| 1 hour - 24 hours     | Every hour          |
| After 24 hours        | 5 times per day     |
