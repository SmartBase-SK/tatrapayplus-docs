# Getting started

To be able to use and test payment gateway you need to have **Client ID** and **Client secret** from [TB developer portal](https://developer.tatrabanka.sk/).

# Installation

To install PHP SDK, you need to install `tatrapayplus/tatrapayplus_api_client` library via composer.\

You can add requirement from command line by running:\
`composer require tatrapayplus/tatrapayplus_api_client=^2.0`

Alternatively, inside your `composer.json` file for your project, add new requirement:
```json
{
    "name": "project name",
    // ...
    "require": {
        // ...
        "tatrapayplus/tatrapayplus_api_client": "2.0.0"
    },
    // ...
}
```
Afterwards, run command `composer install` to install new dependency.

# Client initialization

To start working with the API, you need to initialize the TatraPayPlusAPIApi with the following parameters:

```php
<?php
use Tatrapayplus\TatrapayplusApiClient\Api\TatraPayPlusAPIApi;

$tatrapayplus_api = new TatraPayPlusAPIApi(
    "your-client-id",
    "your-client-secret",
    mode: TatraPayPlusAPIApi::SANDBOX
);
```

There are 2 supported modes:
- `SANDBOX (default)`: requests will be sent to SANDBOX (test) environment of gateway
- `PRODUCTION`: requests will be sent to PRODUCTION (live) environment of gateway
