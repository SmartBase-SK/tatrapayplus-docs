# Getting started

To be able to use and test payment gateway you need to have **Client ID** and **Client secret** from [TB developer portal](https://developer.tatrabanka.sk/).

# Client Initialization

To start working with the API, you need to initialize the `TatrapayPlusClient` with the following parameters:

```python
from tatrapayplus import TatrapayPlusClient
from tatrapayplus.enums import Mode

client = TatrapayPlusClient(
    "your-client-id",                                  # Client ID
    "your-client-secret",                              # Client secret
    mode=Mode.SANDBOX,                                 # Mode you are working with: SANDBOX or PRODUCTION
)
```

There are 2 supported modes:
- `SANDBOX (default)`: requests will be sent to SANDBOX (test) environment of gateway
- `PRODUCTION`: requests will be sent to PRODUCTION (live) environment of gateway
