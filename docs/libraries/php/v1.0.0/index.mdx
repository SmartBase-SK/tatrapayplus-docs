# Getting started

To be able to use and test payment gateway you need to have **Client ID** and **Client secret** from [TB developer portal](https://developer.tatrabanka.sk/).

# Installation

Na inštaláciu PHP SDK je potrebné nainštalovať knižnicu `tatrapayplus/tatrapayplus_api_client` cez composer.

# Client initialization

To start working with the API, you need to initialize the TatraPayPlusAPIApi with the following parameters:

```php
$tatrapayplus_api = new TatraPayPlusAPIApi(
    "your-client-id",
    "your-client-secret",
    mode: TatraPayPlusAPIApi::SANDBOX
);
```

There are 2 supported modes:
- `SANDBOX (default)`: requests will be sent to SANDBOX (test) environment of gateway
- `PRODUCTION`: requests will be sent to PRODUCTION (live) environment of gateway
