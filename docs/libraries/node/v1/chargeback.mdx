# Chargeback

The merchant can also make a full or partial return of the transaction through CardPay.
Returns can only be made on successful payments, including completed pre-authorisations, as well as on payments on which a return has already been made, and the amount of the return must not exceed the original amount of the payment (in the case of a pre-authorisation, it is the amount with which the pre-authorisation was confirmed).
