```

```

## Retrieve payment status

Based on received GET params you should retrieve status of payment as following:

import getPaymentStatus from '!!raw-loader!@site/code_samples/python/v1.0.0/get_payment_status.py';

<CodeBlock language="python">{getPaymentStatus}</CodeBlock>

Result includes a `simple_status` attribute that can have one of three values: `ACCEPTED`, `PENDING`, or `REJECTED`.
Your implementation should take the appropriate action based on the value of `simple_status`.

`data` attribute contains all the information based on structure described in [API reference](/docs/api/get-payment-intent-status).

The response also includes saved card information (if the customer chooses to save their card details).
More details on this feature can be found [üí≥ here üí≥](/docs/libraries/python/v1.0.0/save_card).

## Periodical task

Some payments may be processed later.
Therefore, you should periodically check the status of **"pending" payments**.
We recommend setting up a scheduled task that retrieves all pending payments from your system.
Using the saved `payment_id` with the `get_payment_status` method, you can obtain the current status and take the appropriate action in your system.

Recommended pooling rates based on **age of orders**:

| Time Range            | Polling Frequency   |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| First hour            | Every 5 minutes     |
| 1 hour - 24 hours     | Every hour          |
| After 24 hours        | 5 times per day     |
