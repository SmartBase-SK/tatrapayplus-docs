# Getting available methods

In this payment gateway, user will select preferred payment option directly in payment gateway and **NOT in eshop**.
Therefor you want to inform customer about available payment methods and show different text or image based on certain conditions like:
- currency
- total amount
- country

For this purpose you can retrieve available payment methods with this helper:
<CodeBlock language="python">{getAvailablePaymentMethods}</CodeBlock>

Based on response from these functions you should display info to the user about available methods, 
and then you should create payment.
