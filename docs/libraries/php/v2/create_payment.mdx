# Create Payment

To create a payment using the PHP SDK, call the `TatraPayPlusAPIApi->initiatePayment()` method.

## Common Data

Tatrapay Plus supports multiple payment methods. Depending on the selected method, you can include additional optional fields. However, some data is **mandatory** for all payment types:

```php
$base_payment = new BasePayment([
    "instructed_amount" => new Amount([
        "amount_value" => 10.0,
        "currency" => "EUR",
    ]),
    "end_to_end" => new E2e([
        "variable_symbol" => "ORDER123456",
    ]),
]);
```
:::warning

Most common issue is that value in `instructed_amount.amount_value` field is not rounded properly and API will reject such a data.
Please round your data to **2 decimals places**.

:::

### Modify language and preferred method

By default, tatrapay+ gateway will show all available payment methods and payment gateway is shown in default **Slovak** language.
If you want to change this behaviour you can pass `language` and `preferred_method` param to `create_payment`.

If `preferred_method` is available user will be directly navigated to this method.

<details>
    <summary>Show gateway in English with bank transfer method</summary>

```php
$response = $tatrapayplus_api->initiatePayment(
    "http://localhost",
    $initiate_payment_request,
    preferred_method: "BANK_TRANSFER",
    accept_language: "en"
);
```
</details>

### Redirect URI

Redirect URI is used as return address after customer finishes payment. This URI is necessary and is used to [process result of the payment](/docs/libraries/php/v2/process_payment).

If your application serves multiple locales with distinct URIs for example:
- https://example.com for one locale
- https://example.com/de/ for German users

you must register both URIs in the developer portal.
Then, when making a `create_payment` request, be sure to include the redirect URI that matches the user's locale.
:::warning

This URI must exactly match the URI defined in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.tatrabanka.sk/pages/devportal/sk/#/)

## Specific payment method data

### Bank transfer and QR pay

For this payment method you need to define attribute `bank_transfer`. **It can be empty** or contain additional information.
If you omit this attribute, bank transfer wouldn't be shown.

```php
$bank_transfer = new BankTransfer("Additional information");
```

### Card pay

This payment method requires `card_detail.card_holder`, `user_data.first_name` and `user_data.last_name`.
One of `user_data.email` or `user_data.phone` is required, notifications to customers will be sent based on these.

:::tip

The SDK automatically strips diacritical marks from characters in the `card_detail.card_holder` field, so **you don't need** to handle this conversion yourself.

:::

```php
$userData = new UserData([
    "first_name" => "Janko",
    "last_name" => "Hrasko",
    "email" => "janko.hrasko@example.com",
]);

$cardDetail = new CardDetail([
    "card_holder" => "Janko Hrasko",
]);
```

### PayLater (Na spl√°tky<sup>TB</sup>)

This payment method requires information about items that were bought by customer.
This structure is more complex and description of all fields can be found in [API reference](/docs/api/initiate-payment).

:::warning

The API will reject requests where `instructed_amount.amount_value` doesn't match the **sum of all total_item_price** values.

:::

```php
$payLater = new PayLater([
    "order" => new Order([
        "order_no" => "ORDER123456",
        "order_items" => [
            new OrderItem([
                "quantity" => 1.0,
                "total_item_price" => 10.0,
                "item_detail" => new ItemDetail([
                    "item_detail_en" => new ItemDetailLangUnit([
                        "item_name" => "Product 1",
                    ]),
                    "item_detail_sk" => new ItemDetailLangUnit([
                        "item_name" => "Produkt 1",
                    ]),
                ]),
            ]),
        ],
    ]),
]);
```

## Response

After you create request to initiate payment, you will receive InitiatePaymentResponse with following data:
```php
new InitiatePaymentResponse([
    "payment_id" => 'd7ec77c6-39d8-4011-a462-1a0f1b23f65f',
    "tatra_pay_plus_url" => 'https://api.tatrabanka.sk/tatrapayplus/sandbox/v1/auth?paymentId=d7ec77c6-39d8-4011-a462-1a0f1b23f65f&client_id=l7ba7ffa0bf66b49b88d17dfe144955f54&hmac=7043761cb4cff51d1d084f90cd25d370b89515a1c43c39e6ea459dd504059834',
    "available_payment_methods" => [
        new AvailablePaymentMethod([
            "payment_method" => PaymentMethod::BANK_TRANSFER,
            "is_available" => true,
        ]),
        new AvailablePaymentMethod([
            "payment_method" => PaymentMethod::CARD_PAY,
            "is_available" => true,
        ]),
    ]
]);
```

Example usage:
```php
$response = $tatrapayplus_api->initiatePayment(
    "redirect uri",
    $initiate_payment_request, // instance of InitiatePaymentRequest
);
$response_obj = $response['object'];

$payment_id = $response_obj->getPaymentId();
$tatra_pay_plus_url = $response_obj->getTatraPayPlusUrl();
```

You should save `$payment_id` to your order associated with this payment. You will later need it to [retrieve status of payment](/docs/libraries/php/v2/process_payment).
Then you have two options of displaying payment gateway:
1. Simply redirect user to gateway, field `$tatra_pay_plus_url`.
2. Show payme
